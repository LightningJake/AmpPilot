EV Routing FAQs
What is the average EV range?
Most EVs range from 250-500 km on a full charge depending on model and driving conditions.
How can I find charging stations on the route?
You can use AmpPilot for the optimized ev charging routes.
Do I need to stop for charging on a 300km trip?
If your car range is below 300km, plan at least one optimized route for the charging stop and charge your vehicle.
Charging Station Guide - 
Fast vs Slow Charging
Fast chargers (50kW+) can charge your EV in 30-60 mins. Slow chargers take 4-8 hours.
Common Connector Types
- CCS2: Used in most modern EVs (Tata Nexon, Hyundai etc.)
- CHAdeMO: Used in older Japanese EVs.
Driving Style vs Range
How driving style affects range
- Aggressive driving -> -30% range
- Eco driving -> +20% range
- Moderate driving -> Default rated range
Terrain and Battery
Uphill driving - Increases energy usage and reduces range.
Downhill driving - Uses regenerative braking to save energy.
Flat terrain - Provides most efficient energy usage.
